# Weather-Journal App Project

This repo hosts a simple web application built with `node` and `express`. I made it to demonstrate and explore the use of both internal and third party APIs.

The application basically records journal entries consisting of the current date, the weather information for a user-specified location, and a short note written by the user. The weather information is retrieved from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Setup

1. Clone the project:
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/bfrangi/weather-journal.git
    ```
2. Install packages by running `npm install` inside the project folder.

## Running the project

1. Start the server by running `node server.js` inside the project server.
2. Open up a browser at `localhost:3000`.
3. Enjoy!
